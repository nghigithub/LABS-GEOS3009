EXPERT CARBONATES AND ORGANICS
#
# Use this if the default settings of the carbonates need modifying.
#
# the format for defining membership functions is
# function_name codevariable xpoint1 ypoint1 xpoint2 ypoint2 xpoint3 ypoint3 etc
#
# function_name - user defined variable name
# code_variable - must be one of the key words
#   OUTPUT VARIABLES
#    growth - defines the function as a output membership function controlling carb/org growth rate [m/yr]
#    erosion - defines the function as a output membership function controlling carbonate growth rate [m/yr]
#    porosity - defines the function as a output membership function controlling the porosity [0 - 1]
#    hardness - defines the function as a output membership function controlling the porosity [ >1 ]
#  INPUT VARIABLES
#    depth - water depth [m]
#    current - current velocity in the area - you must have circulation turned on)[m/s]
#    shore - distance in metres to the shoreline[m]
#    rivdist - distance to the nearest fluid element or river source [m]
#    sedrate - sediment rate  [m/year]
#    temp - surface temperature[degrees celcius]
#    expo - The value is calculated by ray tracing from eight different angles around the boundary
#           of the simulation area. Where the ray is stopped when it encounters exposed land.
#           Values vary between 0 and 1, with 0 being a completely land locked body of water (or land itself)
#           through to 1 which would represent water completely exposed from all angles.
#	expotime Ã± time that the layer has been undisturbed on the surface [years]
#    carbdist - distance to nearest surface exposed accumulation of carbonate1 [m]
#	orgdist - distance to nearest surface exposed accumulation of organic1 or organic2 [metres]
#    salinity - degree of salinity in the system (defined in a SALINITY section) [ppm]
#    tidspd - maximum velocity of the tide (defined in a file in the TIDAL SPEED section) [m/s]
#    valley - the normalise number of surrounding points uphill from the reference point
#            (calclated from all grid points within two grid cells)
#            -1 = all points downhill, 1 = all points uphill [-1,1]
#    gradient - the average gradient of the point (calclated from all grid points within two grid cells)
#               negative value indicates that most surrounding points are downhill from the point)
#    grain1 - the percentage of the coarsest grain size in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
#    grain2 - the percentage of the second grain size in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
#    grain3 - the percentage of the third grain size in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
#    grain4 - the percentage of the finest grain size in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
#    carb1 - the percentage of the first carbonate type in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
#    carb2 - the percentage of the second carbonate type in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
#    org1 - the percentage of the first organic type in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
#    org2 - the percentage of the second organic type in the top sediment layer (either basement or deposited material) [0-100]
# 	burial - depth to which the material has been buried by subsequent deposits [meters] (affects material subsurface)
#	age - time since the layer was deposited [years] (affects material subsurface)
#    time - current time [years]
#
# xpoint ypoint - coordinates describing the shape of the membership function. ypoint must be between 0 and 1.
